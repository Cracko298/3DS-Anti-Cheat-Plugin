# NTR-CFW-Anti-Cheat-Plugin
Many 3ds games have cheaters. They ruin the online play, this plugin aims too disable NTR-CFW cheats & plugins during online gameplay. By error'ing the "Void Black" header in NTR's .plg file that is in use by people online and offline.


*Note #1: This is a W.I.P. Anti-Cheat it WILL break & have bugs.

*Note #2: The activation should be "B" your game will immediately crash when it is pressed. As long as with any cheaters online (If you're connected to an online game obv).

*Note #3: This only works for NTR-CFW cheats. Not CTRPF or Luma-Cheats. (And in any game. Not just Ice Station Z or BattleMinerZ).

*Note #4: I made this on a European 3ds. Meaning I have absolutely no clue if it works for JPN, USA, or KOR consoles.

*Note #5: This was originally made for Ice Station Z v1.2 on the 3ds. But it also works in many other games.
